# Exercise 1

Read the player_wage.csv data
(source: https://www.kaggle.com/aishjun/nba-salaries-prediction-in-20172018-season#2017-18_NBA_salary.csv)
and save it as a tibble. The observations in the
data set are NBA players, their information (statistics, nationality,...), and
their wages. For a glossary of NBA terms, see 
https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html.

Peform following tasks:

1. Create a tibble with only Slovenian players.
2. Create a tibble with all USA players who play for Golden State Warriors (GSW).
3. Arrange Players first by age, then by salary, both descending.
4. Create a tibble with columns name, country, draft number, age, and team.
5. Add a new variable to the data frame, minutes per game (MPG).
6. Create a tibble with average salary per team descending.
7. Create a tibble with average salary per country descending,
8. Create a tibble with players from the USA, summarise the salary per minutes played, grouped by team (use the pipe!).
9. Perform an exploratory analysis to find out how wages affect win score (WS). Win score is an estimate of the number of wins contributed by a player.

# Exercise 2

Load the temparture dataset and filter the data to temperatures in Slovenia. Categorize temperature measurements into 6 bins according to the year of the measurement: 1901-1920, 1921-1940, 1941-1960, 1961-1980, 1981-2000, 2001-2015. Use a bar chart to show how temperature moved during these time intervals for each month independenlty (hint: use facet grid).

# Exercise 3

Use exploratory visualizations to analyze how the knowledge of various programming languages, age and programming experience influence developer's salary. Also explore relationships between these variables -- is the number of known programming languages correlated with age, etc. Hint: You can plot each visualization independently or you can use the `cowplot` package to join multiple charts together.
